This research project analyzes nearly 40 rental platforms across short-term, long-term, and vacation rental categories. The objective was to identify competitive strengths, trends, and feature gaps to inform strategic decisions for LeaseEase.

ðŸ“Š Data Collection
The data for this project was collected from multiple sources to ensure comprehensive insights. Key methods included:

Statistical Reports: Data was sourced from industry reports and public datasets to gather market trends and platform performance insights.
Web Scraping: Scraping tools were used to extract detailed information from various rental platforms, ensuring accurate and up-to-date data.
This phase was the most time-consuming, as the data was built entirely from scratch. After collection, the data was thoroughly cleaned in Excel using advanced formulas to handle inconsistencies, missing values, and formatting issues.

In total, nearly 40 rental platforms were analyzed. The data covered key features such as:

Rental Categories: Short-term, long-term, and vacation rentals.
Platform Features: Subscription models, number of listed properties, active listings, and other key attributes.
